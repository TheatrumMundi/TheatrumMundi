A linguistic effect is the product of distinction. The erasure of a distinction is no guarantee that an equivalent will be produced somewhere else (consider how redundant grammatical functions will not necessarily produce the same effects in use or, are not equally weighted), unlike what the linguistics like to imply. This is the rationale for linguistic \u201Cconservatism,\u201D that language can be diminished without equivalent gain.
