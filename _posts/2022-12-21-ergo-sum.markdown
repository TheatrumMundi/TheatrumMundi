“I think therefore I am” means, less succintly: I think; thought is; I am. What is, on the one hand, the most immediately certain thing, that I am insofar as my thought is, must, on the other, be demonstrated, indeed, needs must be a self-demonstration. The foundational thought which secures my self in being is not just any thought, but the thought that demonstrates their identity. We can therefore unfold the simple thought "I think therefore I am" into: "I think I think therefore I am therefore I am." What is given is that the given proves itself, and that the secondary demonstrates itself as primary.

We might assume that anything which need, or indeed does, prove itself primary, is not in fact so; and what preceeds demonstration, even self-demonstration, cannot itself be demonstrated. The certainity of being in thought (that thought is) is probably granted rather than proven, or granted within the proof. The appeal to God, the supreme being, is therefore necessary.
