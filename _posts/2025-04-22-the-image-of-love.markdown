The image of love is a justifying image but also an image of distinction. I mean: I love, for example, the Greek as an image of purity, which demonstrates a distinct being. But that distinction sets him against me, as an image of impurity, which is my distinction (he being simply himself but I being myself in relation to him). But that image which is against me is and is in me, conflictually, so that my love is in conflict, and that is my being, this dissatisfaction. If I were consoled, being simply myself in no relation to him, and therefore as he is supposed in me, I would not have that purity in me which belongs in conflict.
