A symbolic object is by nature anonymous, or: it is capable of being abstracted from the immediate context of its production. This is why objects of mass manufacture cannot develop symbolic value, because the means of their production necessarily entail proper ownership. To give an example: a car cannot ever be a car pure and simple, but always belongs to a line of models which in turn belong under a company's brand. This fact inheres in the car as a product, insofar as there is no other context in which it can be produced.
