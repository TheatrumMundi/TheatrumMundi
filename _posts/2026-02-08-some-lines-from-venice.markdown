*Some leftover lines written in Venice a year ago.*


I

The tree is split. One trunk is wounded as <br>
Christ on Calvary. We know Sebastian, <br>
Being so constrained, is not our Thomas, <br>
Whose doubts, assuaged by blood, drew succour in. <br>

II

I am not worried for you. Those are good <br>
Hands into which you find your lost self soon <br>
Delivered. The waters, above which you stood, <br>
Now reflect the cold and obdurate moon. <br>
