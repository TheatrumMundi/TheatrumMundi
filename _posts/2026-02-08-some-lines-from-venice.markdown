*Some leftover lines written in Venice a year ago.*

I

The image is not image of your death.
Your known icon is not your martyrdom.
We recognise the labour of your breath.
You died later. What is done is done.

II

The tree is split. One trunk is wounded as
Christ on Calvary. We know Sebastian,
Being so constrained, is not our Thomas,
Whose doubts, assuaged by blood, drew succour in.

III

I am not worried for you. Those are good
Hands into which you find your lost self soon
Delivered. The waters, above which you stood,
Now reflect the cold and obdurate moon.
