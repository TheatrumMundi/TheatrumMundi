The notion of craft is abstract when it is merely ideological. Most revivalisms have such a character, because form is appealed to without necessity and is therefore merely an aesthetic <i>preference</i>. But preference is as arbitrary and formless as the formlessness the "aesthetic" proponents of craft oppose. 

Aestheticism is voyeurism.
