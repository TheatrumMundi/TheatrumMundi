The following is mostly unacceptable, but there are a few small successes which justify sharing it regardless. The rendering of the first stanza is especially unfortunate.     

His sight, which moves along the bars, has <br>
become so weary it beholds no more. <br>
It is as if these thousand bars were his <br>
and behind these thousand bars no world. <br>

The soft pass, pliant sturdy pace, <br>
that turns in the all small circle round, <br>
is as the dance around the base, <br>
in which the strong will stands bound. <br>

The pupil’s curtains only sometimes pressed <br>
unsounding up –. An image goes within, <br>
goes through the limbs retensioned rest – <br>
and in the heart gives being in. <br>
