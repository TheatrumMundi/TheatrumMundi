From a first, aborted attempt to write a sonnet as a formal exercise. The major defect is that the form of thought does not agree with the verse form, because the content exceeds the quatrains. But this is not totally unheard of (consider Wyatt's *Avising the Bright Beams*). [Recording](https://voca.ro/13I9pNhtEt9i). 

City of brick, countenance of the years’ <br>
Dry labour, conversant, bodily, <br>
In the old step pealing to new ears, <br>
Listening who do endure, want, waiting, be <br>
Old-song and sallowed testimony — <br>
But was it not enough to want your image? <br>
Which wanting, still, but is bare ceremony — <br>
And these stairs, and this vapour, that ravage- <br>
Ment and filial embrace: a tanglement <br>
Of blue, half-percepted flame burns here still. <br>
Withdrawn, it speaks words no longer meant: <br>
“I am your countryman, of your city still,” <br>
And still I sit apart, and contemplate <br>
The steps on which Gonzaga stept too late. <br>
