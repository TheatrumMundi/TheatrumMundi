The angels in The Triumph of Love are figures of poetry. A voice in the Triumph of Love (CXLVIII), speaking with some authority, says poems are *to console us with their own gift*. This is why the angels, figured in the poem as senders or recipients, record the transmission of message which is never specified itself, because they stand as their own message.
