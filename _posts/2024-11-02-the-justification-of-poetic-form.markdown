The justification of poetic form is the perfect agreement of form and content, or their indifference. This agreement is a singular perfection of phrasing and formal construction. However, language will always be public, communicable, translatable, and, in the case of poetry, prosable. Something which is said, or only sayable, one way, in one form, is no longer language, expresses and communicates nothing. The poet therefore communicates despite himself, and this tension is the force of poetic achievement.
