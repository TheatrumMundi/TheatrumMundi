*The subject of this sonnet is a medallion, found on the left side of the entrance to the Church of Saint Sebastian in Venice, of peculiar typology.*

Poverty of blood, that is indigence, <br> 
```Is squandered; and what image that remains,``` <br>
```Suggesting neither guilt nor innocence,``` <br> 
```Is white stone that bares nothing through its veins.``` <br> 

Those are its marble limbs, which do not flinch; <br>
```The limp composure of the drooping wrist``` <br>
```Upon the bark: see, there are the ropes which pinch``` <br>
```The stone, the pain the wounds of love have kissed.```<br>

But it is no use: that I on its parted lips <br>
```Have wavered, and do want what scarce I sense,``` <br>
```Who have touched my error to its fingersâ€™ tips,``` <br>
```And pulled at the arrow through my prurience: ```<br>

To find no answer, knowing well what is his, <br>
```That is: to bear a cross which no longer is.``` <br>
