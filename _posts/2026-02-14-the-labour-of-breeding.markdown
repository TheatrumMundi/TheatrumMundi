The western peoples are now retreating into passive concepts, such as "indigenousness," apparently useful for rhetorical reasons, to justify their own existence and the existence of their polities, because they have become alien observers of their own nature. It is a source of comfort, for a race alienated from itself yet still driven by a confused sense of self-preservation, to regard the race as a fact passively given by nature. But races are only "given" insofar as they are received, which reception has been historically termed "breeding." This is because races are bred into being, and there is a program (social, cultural, customary) which reinforces, reproduces, and justifies this, circumscribing the limits of its character, which is also called "breeding," so that "breeding" is at once *the means and ends of itself*.[^1] In short, race is as much a construct of society as society is a construct of race. This is what the word "breeding" names. 

Further, it is important to recognise that the concept of "indigenousness" is passive in two ways: it implies a racial passivity, which could be called "racial naturalism," such as already described, and, at a higher level, a social passivity in addition to this, which assumes a *given relation between a race and its land*. This is contrary to the obvious truth that societies are not the product of the land itself, which by itself is nothing other than its own character, but of its *settlement and development*, which is the sole origin of any possible legal title. The conclusion to be drawn from this is also obvious: that "indigenousness," no matter who is using it, is no more than a rhetorical tool, used to obscure the matter, political and existential, of which races will occupy and develop the land, *within the norms of an already existing polity*. This polity, as is clear from the fact that its legitimacy is *contested*, is not a fact given by nature, but, like all polities, is instead *the labour of a certain race*, which is in turn the *labour of breeding*, so that we might fairly call breeding *the first labour*, before we can speak of labour in any other sense.

[^1]: I.e. sexual reproduction, its norms, and the character it hopes to produce, producing boundaries moral and aesthetic, individual and social, domestic and political, economic and national.
