The western peoples are now retreating into passive concepts, such as "indigenousness," apparently useful for rhetorical reasons, to justify their own existence and the existence of their polities, because they have become alien observers of their own nature. It is a source of comfort, for a race alienated from itself yet still driven by a confused sense of self-preservation, to regard the race as a fact passively given by nature. But races are only "given" insofar as they are received; which give-and-take has been historically termed "breeding." This is because races are bred into being, and there is a program (social, cultural, customary) which reinforces, reproduces, and *justifies* this, circumscribing the limits of its character, which is also called "breeding," so that "breeding" is at once *the means and ends of itself*.[^1]

Further, it is important to recognise that the concept of "indigenousness" is passive in two ways: it implies a racial passivity, which could be called "racial naturalism," such as already described, and, at a higher level, a social passivity in addition to this, which assumes a *given relation between a race and its land*. This is contrary to the obvious truth that societies are not the product of the land itself, which by itself is nothing other than its own character, but of its *settlement and development*, which is the sole origin of any possible legal title. The conclusion to be drawn from this is also obvious: that "indigenousness," no matter who is using it, is no more than a rhetorical tool, used to obscure the matter, political and existential, of which races will occupy and develop the land, *within the norms of an already existing polity*. This polity, as is clear from the fact that its legitimacy is *contested*, is not a fact given by nature, but, like all polities, is instead *the labour of a certain race*, which is in turn the *labour of breeding*, so that we might fairly call breeding *the first labour*, before we can speak of labour in any other sense.

[^1]: We speak of breeding as sexual reproduction and the breeding as the production of a certain character: their relation is mutual and self-reinforcing. Consider not only sexual reproduction, breeding in the biological sense, but also its norms, the features which are its aims, and the obligations incumbent upon the bred, producing boundaries moral and cultural, individual and familial, domestic and political, social and national.
