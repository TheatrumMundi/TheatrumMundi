I have attempted on and off for several years to make this composition work, and this is its latest state, likely to be subject to further revision, although found satisfying enough for now to be seen by the handful of people who will see it. 

What was the dream which was its reason <br>
Is long in waiting satisfaction. We have <br>
Felt it, which was not felt to be returned: <br>
That love, that burled about your breast, is smoke <br>

In alabaster. No beauty, which spared <br>
So little, so reproached us then as now <br>
In witness. The dream, you said, will be <br>
The white of ivory is blind and blinding, <br>
As hoarfrost coats the handle of the yoke. <br>
